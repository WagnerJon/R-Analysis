# R-Analysis by Jonas Wagner

This project shows step-by-step how a fully featured analysis of Morris Water Maze experiment data is done within R.  

At first the [`RTrack`](https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/) library was used to analyze metrics from the raw ethovision files that were available, then first simple plots of those experiment metrics and heatmaps of different experiment paradigms were created. With the [`RTrack`](https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/) package by Ruper Overall and his extensive documentation all of this can be done with a few lines of code and without much previous knowledge. If you are looking for a full guide how to use [`RTrack`](https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/), take a look at the official [documentation](https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/articles/Rtrack_MWM_analysis.html).

In my R-Analysis notebook I additionally explored the possibilites of [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)  and [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/getting-started/) and kept some errors I did in order to show some common mistakes and how to solve them. 

# Methology

The most important metrics we wanted to extract from the raw data were the strategy usages and how they differ between Strains, Age groups, Housing and all combinations of those. Therefore we once again used [`RTrack`](https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/) to predict the strategies used by the mice for each Trial.  For each Trial we computed one of these tables, where the called strategy plus the confidence for all strategies are shown.

We then assigned each track the strategy class 0 or 1 depending on their hippocampus-dependency. The assignment was done following figure 3 in *Garthe et. al. 2016*, where 'unspatial' strategies were labled with strategy class 0 and 'spatial' strategies were labled with class 1.

WeÂ´ve then done a logistic regression, which is a statistical model for a regression analysis. To do this, we first applied different logistic regression models with increasing complexity to our data and compared them using the ANOVA function. With this we choose the minimal adequate model, which is the simplest model, that describes the data appropiatly. With this model, we then could compute a prediction, which is the propability of a mouse of a specific experiment paradigm, choosing strategy class 1 and therefore using a hippocampus dependent strategy.
