# R-Analysis by Jonas Wagner

This project shows step-by-step how a fully featured analysis of Morris Water Maze experiments is done within R.  

At first the [`RTrack`](https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/) library was used to analyze metrics from the raw ethovision files that were available, then first simple plots of those experiment metrics and heatmaps of different experiment paradigms were created. With the [`RTrack`](https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/) package by Ruper Overall and his extensive documentation all of this can be done with a few lines of code and without much previous knowledge. If you are looking for a full guide how to use [`RTrack`](https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/), take a look at the official [documentation](https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/articles/Rtrack_MWM_analysis.html).

In my R-Analysis notebook I additionally explored the possibilites of [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)  and [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/getting-started/) and kept some errors I did in order to show some common mistakes and how to solve them.
