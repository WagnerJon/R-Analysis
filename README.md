# R-Analysis by Jonas Wagner

This project shows step-by-step how a fully featured analysis of Morris Water Maze experiments is done within R. 
At first the `RTrack` library was used to analyze metrics from the raw ethovision files that were available, to create first simple plots of those experiment metrics and to create heatmaps of different experiment paradigms.
