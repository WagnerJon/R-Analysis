This project shows step-by-step how a fully featured analysis of Morris Water Maze experiments is done within R.  

At first the [`RTrack`](https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/) library was used to analyze metrics from the raw ethovision files that were available, then first simple plots of those experiment metrics and heatmaps of different experiment paradigms were created.
